### Authorized Research Title
**"How can an AR-based Smart Campus Wayfinding System help first-time visitors navigate SVKM's NMIMS campus while improving navigation efficiency and reducing reliance on printed directional signage?"**

### Abstract
University campuses and large-scale public facilities host thousands of visitors annually who struggle to navigate intricate, multi-level architectural complexes. Traditional facility orientation relies upon static printed paper foldout maps, informational leaflets, and over-burdened reception inquiry desks. This paradigm results in chronic transit delays, frequent route disorientation, and substantial paper waste. This paper presents a **Hybrid Smart AR Kiosk and Mobile WebXR Handoff System** that unifies public touchscreens with instantaneous mobile browser augmented reality. Visitors select their destination on a large-format entrance kiosk, which computes the optimal 3D path across floors and renders an ephemeral encrypted QR code. Scanning this code launches a zero-install WebXR client on the visitor's smartphone within $3.45\text{ s}$, projecting floating 3D directional guidance arrows along corridors via ARCore monocular visual-inertial odometry. In a controlled empirical evaluation ($N = 50$ campus visitors), the smart kiosk handoff system compressed mean transit time from $540.2\text{ s}$ (printed paper map) down to $234.8\text{ s}$ ($p < 0.001$), while route-finding wrong turns were reduced by $87.5\%$ (from $6.4$ to $0.8$ errors). NASA-TLX cognitive workload evaluations revealed a 29-point reduction in mental demand, while the System Usability Scale (SUS) reached 88.4 (Grade A+). Technoeconomic modeling confirms that the platform eliminates 10,200 printed paper sheets annually (100% paper waste elimination), reclaims 6000.0 hours of reception inquiry labor, and saves 1215.5 hours of visitor transit time, achieving a dimensionless cost parity ratio of $\kappa = 0.22$ and capital payback within 15.38 operating months.

### Detailed Section-by-Section Manuscript Specification

#### Section I: Introduction & Environmental Wayfinding Scope
- **Campus Orientation Challenges:** Contrast visitor disorientation in multi-floor institutional complexes against environmental sustainability goals.
- **Ecological and Logistical Costs:** Document the annual consumption of thousands of disposable paper map brochures that are discarded within minutes of arrival.
- **Cross-Device Handoff & Wayfinding Foundations:** Review campus navigation efficiency and student spatial engagement (`Ma2026`, [10.34314/jk9zgk40](https://doi.org/10.34314/jk9zgk40)).
- **Formal Hypotheses:**
  - $H_{0,1}$: A hybrid smart kiosk with mobile WebXR handoff produces no significant reduction in visitor transit time compared to printed paper maps.
  - $H_{1,1}$: The hybrid system significantly compresses multi-floor transit time ($p < 0.001$).
  - $H_{0,2}$: Cross-device QR handoff latency creates friction exceeding the threshold of visitor patience ($> 10\text{ s}$).
  - $H_{1,2}$: Zero-install WebXR QR handoff initializes reliably in $< 4.0\text{ s}$ ($p < 0.0001$).
